#### This documentâ€™s goal is to serve as a guideline for expanding our data science skillset.
#### Some high level learning ideas not yet implemented into the curriculum:
- learn more about data collection: data collection strategies, setting up experiments based on data collection, generating data specifically designed to feed ML models
- increase proficiency in testing multiple algorithms/paradigms for new problems
#### To-do:
- add separate documents/folders for each chapter, including sources, notes, etc
- assign a rough timeline to the learning
- finish the list of topics
- review the list of topics
