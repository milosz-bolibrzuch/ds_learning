#### Over time we should divide these categories into subcategories.

### 1. Statistics
#### Here we can include any good materials on probability, combinatorics, statistics.


### 2. Machine learning theory
#### Here we can include resources for learning theory behind machine learning areas (e.g. XGBoost slides)

### 3. Machine learning practice
#### Resources to help with implementation and practical uses (e.g. implementation examples in Python, examples of problems solved for specific algorithms/combinations of algorithms, etc)

### 4. What else is there? Add suggestions!
